    lowercase letters, so you will have to handle uppercase and mixed case strings
    appropriately.

        The score for a word is the product of two components:

        The first component is the sum of the points for letters in the word.
        The second component is the larger of:
            1, or
            7*wordlen - 3*(n-wordlen), where wordlen is the length of the word
            and n is the hand length when the word was played

        worth 3, C is worth 3, D is worth 2, E is worth 1, and so on.
